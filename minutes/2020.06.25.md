# Governance WG meeting 2020 JUNE 25

## Discussion topic: Defining relationship of groups to each other and Rust project

## Background material
* This fits into past discussion about:<br>
    * what is a project<br>
    * definition of [project groups and their lifecycle](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/rfcs/blob/project-groups/text/0000-project-groups.md) <br>
    * the purpose of domain working groups<br>
    * the place of community groups in (or outside of) the Rust org<br>

## Minutes
- Observation of perpetual confusion about the idea of working groups vs project groups etc. 
- Idea of subteams already exists
- Therefore:<br>
    * project groups = execute a defined, often cross-cutting, project with relatively well-defined scope (e.g., project-ffi-unwind)<br>
    * teams and subteams = indefinite entities that exist to tend to a given area, codebase, etc.<br>
- domain working groups not associated with a team
    * previously they weren't considered to have decision-making power<br>
    * now they can make decisions but those are limited in scope<br> 

## Decisions
- Going forward there will be two types of groups in the Rust organization<br>
    * Teams<br>
    * Project groups parented by those teams, have a charter, do not have final decision-making power<br>
    * Subteams that refine the work of their parent team (e.g. community/events or compiler/prioritization)<br>
    * Subteams cover a defined area, they are not trying to create a project<br>
- The Rust Project will not list or link to any community groups, or keep community projects on its Github
- If community groups want folks to find them they can create a group on the [Mozilla Community Portal](https://community.mozilla.org/), which the Rust Project will link to instead of any individual groups

## Action items
- Writing the proposal in detail
- Look at/talk with existing groups and describe how they fit into this taxonomy
