# Meeting 2019.11.19

## Attending

nikomatsakis, nellshamrell, xampprocky, batmanaod

## Goal

- Review [the governance RFC](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1068-rust-governance.html)
- Decide topic for next meeting

## Notes

- Draft terminology RFC https://hackmd.io/s/rJn0cDFsB

## Xampp Rocky

Things that don't seem to be happening:

- Scalability: talking about the RFC process, this mentions RFCs being closed or assigned a shepherd, but this is not accurate
- Subteams publishing status of RFCs regularly
  - In practice, many of them can stall in a variety of phases
  - Sometimes in "almost FCP"
  - Not a clear distinction of which RFCs are being worked on and which are not, or where the focus is
  - We haven't talked so much about how to surface this information
  - Ideally I think github PRs would be trimmed down
    - right now, people open up RFCs for anything they want to have added, some of them get outdated
- In some cases, the team policies have changed
  - e.g. libs team prefers to have direct PRs for smaller additions
- Initial list of teams is out of date
  - Doesn't include release team and some other newer teams
  - teams are supposed to have an RFC policy but that is not up to date
- Feature gating
  - core team is listed as deciding to ungate but in practice this is not true
- Core team
  - not mentioned how the core team is formed apart from the requirement that leads of teams are part of core team
  - "observer role" has not been formalized, is there a path to membership?
    - generally true for other teams as well

## Niko

- Consensus
  - Subteam leaders:
    - Making final decisions in cases of contentious RFCs that are unable to reach consensus otherwise (should be rare).
      - this isn't what we've done in practice, see below

## Kyle

- Question that has arisen:

  - "recourse" if core team gets out of sync?
    - based on commentary

- Role of the core team
  - In practice, the core team hasn't really gotten involved in technical decisions
    - it's never happened that the core team tries to overrule team decisions, or even been close to happening
    - core team members sometimes get involved in discussions, and are treated like any other respected member of the community, but don't generally overrule (e.g.) on the naming of a function or something like that
  - Core team focused on governance itself, functioning of the project, mediation between people
    - edition mechanism was a core team decision
    - has technical aspects but it is ultimately a project policy decision
  - Interesting examples that are "almost core"
    - future compatibility warning policy
      - is it core? feels a bit smaller
    - target tier policy
  - Tagging of teams
    - nobody wants jurisdiction of a problem
      - deprecation policy around github projects --
        - how do we set the "procedure" around deprecation?
        - is that release team? or is it govenance wg? or who?
        - release team might execute it, but not necessarily set policy
        - does that default to core?
    - dispute about "who has jurisdiction"
      - example dispute around the `!` stabilization
- How to improve communication?
  - How can we provide stucture to improve communication?
  - Seems like something that would require deeper analysis from looking at teams

## Things that have been "added" since the RFC was written

- New teams and roles within teams
  - core team observer, lang team shepherds, [compiler team contributors](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2689-compiler-team-contributors.html)
- Domain working groups
- Project groups
- RFC policy changes for certain teams
  - new teams have no policy, old team policies are out of date
- Inside Rust blog

## Things that have changed or just not happened

- Subteam lead resolving contentious issues
- Feature gating decided by teams, not by core team
- In general, core team has not been involved in technical decision making, and has been more focused on policy

## Things that could be improved

- Regularly looking over the policy documents to see if they still reflect reality

## Output and goals

- This meeting: come up with a plan for updating the RFC to be more inline with how community functions
  - Define working groups / project groups ([draft](https://hackmd.io/s/rJn0cDFsB))
- Convert the text of RFC 1068 to a forge structure

  - Governance
    - RFC Policies
      - Language changes
      - Library additions

- Create `draft RFC` folder in `wg-governance` repo.

## Next meeting sketches

- Follow-up on this meeting
- Access policy thing -- get pietro or some other folks, maybe, but can they make this time?
- RFC proposal https://github.com/nikomatsakis/project-staged-rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0001-shepherded-rfcs.md
- Try to contact non-Rust people

## Next meeting run by Nell

- Follow-up from this meeting:

  - Record minutes
  - Write a blog post summarizing some of this discussion

- Access policy
  - Homework:
    - read [issue #4] which has the discussion
    - Nell to talk to pietro
