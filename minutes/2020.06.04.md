# Governance WG meeting 2020 JUNE 4

## Discussion topic: Working groups, and what are they
Goal: Progress in definition of groups

## Background material
- This fits into past discussion about:
    * definition of [project groups and their lifecycle](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/rfcs/blob/project-groups/text/0000-project-groups.md) 
## Minutes
- Responses to survey not very helpful, other than:<br>
    * Embedded team would like to be more integrated
- We have a mix of working group types
- Notes on [what is the scope of a Domain working group](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Domain-Working-Group-Scope-LHeTtnyfLesp1lLbv4jUY)
- How should Rust governance model include focused/cross-cutting groups
- What goals we are trying to achieve with groups
- Project groups are a way of building groups around cross-cutting concerns between the teams, or for a team to split up responsibilities around its projects or a particular concept.
- It only makes sense to try and form groups that are central to Rust’s roadmap and objectives, or tightly tied in to existing leadership structures
- Having an open-ended application process risks creating many groups, some of which will fail, and that will distract and take energy
- Groups are meant to help guide the teams to improve support for particular areas, and with too many groups there is no focus there
- What are we trying to accomplish with Domain Working Groups, Team-based Working Groups, Project Groups, etc?
    * bring in new people, fill in gaps, build up expertise, improve existing ecosystem
    * liaison ties them in to parent group
    * if say project decides "we should push on GUI this year", how do we do that?
- Community groups provide minimal structure for folks to self-organize
    * These are not “official” parts of Rust, this is just a directory to help people self-organize
    * The group provides its own chat platform, github repo (not in rust-lang), discourse instance, whatever
    * these are readily available and free
    * They must meet some minimal criteria (CoC) and if there are complaints (e.g., poor moderation) we’ll remove them from our list
- We might want to start some kind of developer outreach in order to get feedback more proactively, especially from companies who won't post their complaints on the forums.
- Need to clarify when the core team can make unilateral decisions, especially w/ respect to responsibilities usually handled by other groups.
- Overall goal: Move the Rust Project forward

## Action items
- Niko post comment to those who had applied for domain WG
