## How can I get involved?

_[See our current list of members here](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/core#wg-governance)._

If you'd like to get involved, the best idea right now is to introduce yourself
in our [zulip stream][zulip] â€” and perhaps consider attending the next triage meeting to get involved.

## Work style & Meetings

We mainly use [Github issues][issues] to organise our work, as well as discuss changes on [Zulip].

We have a bi-weekly meeting, typically focused on single item in the agenda, with a rotating chair for
handling the meeting. It takes place every other Thursday 18:00 GMT (starting Feburary 27th 2020) on
Zulip. Attendance is not mandatory but we expect to update the tickets with the latest information
leading to it, so the triage can check it off and archive, postpone or re-assign it accordingly.
