# wg-governance

This is the repository for the Rust Governance Working Group, looking to work on improving Rust's internal processes.

You can read the announcement about this [here](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/governance-working-group-announcement/9637).

We're still figuring out how to proceed as a group; over time this repository will be updated with more information on what we're doing, what our charter is, how to get involved, etc.

Our members can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/core#wg-governance)
